### Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

Aviator is a simple yet thrilling crash game. The basic concept revolves
around predicting when a multiplier will crash. Here's a step-by-step
guide on how to play:

1.  **Start a Round:** Once you open the Aviator app, choose your bet
    amount and start the round.
2.  **Watch the Multiplier:** As soon as the round starts, the plane
    will begin to fly. The multiplier will increase as the plane
    ascends.
3.  **Cash Out Before the Plane Crashes:** Your goal is to cash out your
    bet before the plane crashes. The longer you wait, the higher the
    multiplier becomes, but the risk of crashing increases.
4.  **Win or Lose:** If you cash out before the crash, you win the
    amount multiplied by the multiplier. If the plane crashes before you
    cash out, you lose the bet.

    gameplay mechanics, including the timing of cashing out and
    understanding the game's pace.

    strategies and figure out the best approach before playing with real
    money.
